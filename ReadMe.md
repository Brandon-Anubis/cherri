**Cherri** (pronounced cherry) is a [iOS Siri Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334)
programming language, that compiles directly to a valid runnable Shortcut.

- #Ô∏è‚É£ Include files within each other or auto-include.
- üîß Define your own custom actions.
- ü•© Raw actions

### **üì£ WIP üì£**

This project has not yet reached a stable version. It is under heavy development, and backwards
incompatible changes may be made.

## Usage

```bash
cherri file.cherri
```

Run `cherri` without any arguments to see all options and usage. For development, use the `--debug` (or `-d`) option for
stack traces and to output a .plist file.

## Why macOS only?

Generating valid Shortcuts is only possible on macOS. However, I am hoping to add a signing server to
the [web editor](https://playground.cherrilang.org) that will turn out valid Shortcuts on any platform with a web
browser.

### Development on other platforms

As it stands, I don't want someone to get confused and think Shortcuts compiled using Cherri on other platforms will run
on their Mac or iOS device. However, you can build the compiler for your platform, it will just skip signing the
compiled Shortcut, so it will not run on iOS 15+ or macOS 12+. Also note that the compiler is primarily developed and
tested on Unix-like systems.

## Why another Shortcuts language?

Because it's fun :)

Some languages have been abandoned, don't work very well, or no longer work. I don't want Shortcuts languages to die.
There should be more, not less.

Some stability that comes with the project being on macOS and not iOS. I am not aware of any
project [other than one](https://github.com/zachary7829/Buttermilk) that compiles a
Shortcut in a way that is meant for a desktop OS.

_The original Workflow app assigned a code name to each release. Cherri is named after the second to last
update "Cherries" (also cherry is one of my favorite flavors)._

This project started on Oct 5, 2022.
